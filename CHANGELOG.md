# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

First release as a standalone project (previously embedded in a workstation
configuration role).

### Added

- `streamstack` CLI: `doctor`, `studio`, `stop`, `status` (`--short`,
  `--icon` for panel buttons), `cameras`, `preview` (any device and mode,
  thirds grid), `mic-check` (raw/processed A/B), `voice`, `canon-bridge`,
  `setup`, `call-settings`, `auto`, `--version`.
- `streamstack-tray`: panel menu (`--menu`) and tray icon with studio
  start/stop, auto mode, voice presets and bypass, per-mode camera previews,
  and the last Claude note.
- Auto mode (`streamstack auto`): local auto-exposure with face spot metering
  and speech-gated mic levelling; Claude passes through the restricted Claude
  Code CLI (`--restricted --tools Read --json-schema`) or the Anthropic API
  (forced tool use); confidence gating, adaptive pacing, black/flat frame
  guards, a rotating journal, and `auto reset` to undo every change.
- Settings layered from defaults, `/etc/streamstack/streamstack.env` and
  `~/.config/streamstack/streamstack.env`; `STREAMSTACK_MICROPHONE` selects
  the call microphone and an unplugged one is never silently replaced.
- Five Easy Effects voice presets, the OBS profile and scene collection, panel
  icons, systemd user units, desktop entries, `make install` and a wheel.
